Calculator

Basic calculator that allows the user to select a number system from binary to hexadecimal. The calculator digits are dynamically displayed based on the selection. I wanted the option to select from some common systems or to manually put in any radix from 2 to 16. When a radix is entered that isn't one of the named options then an "Other" option is created and selected. The "Other" option disappears when one of the named options is selected.

When I get some more time I would like to explore accessibility, internationalization, and implementing a state machine library like xstate.
